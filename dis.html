        <h3>Disopinionated</h3>
        <p>In a sense, a protocol is like a fine wine, older is better. It is easy to fall into the trap of the new and shiny. We are conditioned to believe that the new is always beter, but often it is the well seasoned, timeless forms that yield the best results.</p>
        <p>On the web, this idea is more true than ever. Your website should be built with the simplest possible technology that meets your needs.  This avoids expensive rewrites because a bug was found in the "framework" used to build it. Your site should rely on classic, well trusted design principles and protocols. </p>
        <h3>Simple is Smart</h3>
        <p>Keeping things as simple as possible has advantages. It lasts a long time.  The websites I build should work just as well 20 years from now as they do when you take delivery. I keep things simple by using a well defined "stack" of protocols and languages. The stack I use is HTML/CSS/JS on the front end and Python/Flask with a database on the back end. The front end part of this site is written using only the HTML/CSS/JS part of the stack. It is simple. 
        </p>
        <h3>Code Ownership</h3>
        <p>Some web developers try to lock you into monthly payments.  They often recommend features that are complex or include features that you don't need. Features like a contact form require a backend and monthly payments.  For most sites it is better to simply list your businesses address and phone number in the HTML. No backend and no monthly payments. </p>
        <p>When hire me to build a website, you own the finished product including all the code. When you take delivery of a simple/static site we are done.  You can take the code to someone else for maintenance or rebuilding. Complex sites may require some periodic maintenance, but even with complex sites, you own the code and I can can help you with things like migration or access for any developer you choose. Details about these items will provided when you take delivery.
