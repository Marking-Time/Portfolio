            <h3>Complex Websites</h3>
            <p>
            Complex websites have one or more of the following characteristics. They have a custom design that the developer needs to spend time implementing, or the customer has hired a designer to create a unique website and the developer has to spend time figuring out how to implement it.  There is often a great deal of back and forth between the designer, customer and developer before the website is finished. The end product is often stunning.</p>
            <p>
            Also included in this category are sites that have complex data needs such as backend connectivity like a user input form, extensive Java Script(JS), or extensive Cascading Style Sheets(CSS).
            <p> 
            Because of the above, these sites a billed by the hour.  I will provide an estimate and communicate with the customer on the progress.  This site, for example, is based on one of my templates, but it does have some extra CSS and a little JS to glue it together. I designed it myself. I would charge a premium over a simple template site, but it wouldn't be outrageous.</p>
            <h3>Designers</h3>
            The most visually appealing sites will be created by a designer.  Designers have training and experience in art and graphic design and can specify colors, fonts, images, logos, layouts, effects and more. The designer will create a "wire frame" for your site that specifies all of the above for me, the developer. In short, they create the design and the developer implements it. Designers sometimes use the marketing "branding expert" to identify themselves and can provide a "branding kit" containing the above that the customer can use for other things like signage, business cards and more. 

            <p>
            I also designed the logo myself.  This is not a service that I offer. The customer will either need to hire a designer or use one of the free online logo generators.
            </p>
            <h3>Photographers</h3>
            <p>Hiring a photographer is another great way to make your site unique.  Professional photographers have the skills, tools, training and experience to make your site stand out.  Sometimes the designer and the photographer are the same person, but they can often operate separately</p>
