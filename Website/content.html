	<h3>Disopinionated</h3>
	  <p>In a sense, a protocol is like a fine wine, older is better. It is easy to fall into the trap of the new and shiny. We are conditioned to believe that the new is always beter, but often it is the well seasoned, timeless forms that yield the best results.</p>
	  <p>On the web, this idea is more true than ever. Your website should be built with the simplest possible technology that meets your needs.  This avoids expensive rewrites because a bug was found in the "framework" used to build it. Your site should rely on clasic, well trusted design principles and protcols. </p>
  	<h3 id="simple">Simple is Smart</h3>
  	<p>Keeping things as simple as posible has advantages. It lasts a long time.  The websites I build should work just as well 20 years from now as they do when you take delivery. I keep things simple by using a well defined "stack" of protocols and languages. The stack I use is HTML/CSS/JS on the front end and Python/Flask/JSON on the back end. This site is written using only the HTML/CSS part of the stack. It is simple.

    <h3>Simplicity</h3>
    <p style="margin-bottom:0px">
    The simplest sites are the least expensive.  They use templates to create a rich visual experience for your content. The goal for these sites is to tell the story of your business and provide your contact information. <br><br>
    They are considered simple(somtimes called static sites) because they do not take in any data to store or mainipulate.  They also do not have many custom features requiring extensive coding.</p>
    <h3 id="templates">Templates</h3>
    <p>A sample of templates are listed below.  They can be built with your content for about $100 per page. You can customize these templates with your own images and type styles. You can also add lists and headings that make your content easier to read.</p>
    <p>
    	All of the sites I build are both responsive and accessible. They work well with screen readers for the visualy impaired as well as mobile devices.

  	<!-- <b>Templates</b><br>
  	<p>I use <a href="#templates">templates</a> that replicate commonly used website styles.  This reduces the amount of new code that I need to write for your site. You provide all the content including images, text and logos as well as choosing the colors that you like and I plug those into template. </p> -->
